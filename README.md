# Neural Network

## Perceptrons
- Perceptrons can represent all of the primitive boolean functions AND, OR, NAND, and NOR. This ability is important because every boolean function can be represented by some network of interconnected units based on these primitives

## The BACK-PROPAGATION algorithm
- Assumes the network is a fixed structure that corresponds to a directed graph, possibly containing cycles. Learning corresponds to choosing a weight value for each egde in the graph
